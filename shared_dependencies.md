Shared Dependencies:

1. Libraries: Both `yfinance` and `backtester` libraries are shared across the files. They are used for data retrieval and backtesting respectively.

2. Variables: The `data` variable, which holds the downloaded trading data, is shared across all files. It is initially defined in "data_retrieval.py", then used in "data_preparation.py" for cleaning and preprocessing, in "strategy_development.py" for generating buy and sell signals, in "backtesting.py" for backtesting the strategy, and finally in "results_analysis.py" for evaluating the backtest results.

3. Classes and Methods: The `Strategy` class and its methods `buy_signal` and `sell_signal` are shared between "strategy_development.py" and "backtesting.py". They are defined in "strategy_development.py" and used in "backtesting.py" for backtesting the strategy.

4. Objects: The `backtester` object is shared between "backtesting.py" and "results_analysis.py". It is instantiated in "backtesting.py" and used in "results_analysis.py" for accessing the backtest results.

5. Constants: The `symbol`, `start_date`, and `end_date` constants are shared across the files. They are used for specifying the stock or index and the date range for the trading data.
